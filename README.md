# Beautiful-Soup-2019-Meetup

Many data analysis, big data, and machine learning projects require scraping websites to gather the data that youâ€™ll be working with. The Python programming language is widely used in the data science community, and therefore has an ecosystem of modules and tools that you can use in your own projects.

Beautiful Soup, is a Python library that allows for quick turnaround on web scraping projects. Currently available as Beautiful Soup 4 and compatible with both Python 2.7 and Python 3, Beautiful Soup creates a parse tree from parsed HTML and XML documents (including documents with non-closed tags or tag soup and other malformed markup).

Join us on Monday the 27th of May, 2019 from 4:00 pm to 7:00 pm at the Colab (room 329 in the ERC of Unimelb) to learn how to scrape static websites using Beautiful soup 4. We will be meeting at the Colab Follow the dog for directions: https://tinyurl.com/tram2colab, https://tinyurl.com/coffee2colab
